# Live SEO optimizations for Silverstripe

This module was largely rewritten from hubertusanton/silverstripe-seo to provide real-time feedback & SEO tips to CMS editors. Where the original module handles this in php (on page save), this module's feedback logic was written in javascript, hence 'Live SEO'. For the time being we have decided to let both modules co-exist, as they both do the job just fine, and this allows developers to pick the version that suits them best (php or javascript).

- Real-time in-CMS SEO page analysis with tips & score (moved to js, no need to save/refresh)
- Configurable Title template for search snippet visualisation (from within siteconfig)
- Multiple keyword support in no particular order (eg "dogs drinking beer" = "drinking my beer while watching the dog")
- Checks & suggests installs of other modules that are good for SEO (GoogleSitemap)
- Auto-set GoogleSitemap::google_notification_enabled(true) if available
- Added support for Facebook & Google+ author markup
- Added support for in-page meta robots settings
- Added some additional tests & tips from Yoast's WP SEO plugin
- Largely based on Bart's/30's Silverstripe SEO plugin (basically half of this plugin)
- Re-adds the 'MetaTitle' field that was removed in SilverStripe 3.1 (thanks to Loz Calver)
